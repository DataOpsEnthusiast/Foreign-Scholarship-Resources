  - Argument based essay (30 min allowed time)

- `Verbal:`
  - Contains 20 questions.
  - 30 min time (avg of 90 sec for each question).

- `Quant (Maths):`
  - 20 questions.
  - 35 min.
  - 105 sec each (avg).

- There maybe an experimental section (either verbal or quant)
- The whole process of test can take more than `four hours`.
- All the sections can take place in any order.
- This may look like: **QVQVQ** or **VQVQV**.

### Maths Section Question Domain Estimation:
- Problem Solving (60%)
- Quantitative Comparison (40%)

### Verbal Section Question Type Estimation:
- `Text Completions:` around 7 per section.
  - One blank: ~2
  - Two blank: ~2-3
  - Three blank: ~2-3
- `Sentence Equivalence:` ~4 per section.
- `Reading Comprehension:` ~9 per section (including paragraph argument).

### 1.5: Scoring in GRE
- Each question is worth 1 point.
- Scoring Ranges:
  - Both verbal and quant (maths) sections have score ranges of `130-170` each.
  - Total score: **340** max.
  - 170 verbal + 170 quant.
  - Overall score range: `260-340`.
  - Essay: `0.0 - 6.0`.
  - Score above 315 is considered to be a good score.


### 1.6: Section Adaptation (IMPORTANT)
- There are three difficulty levels in GRE:
  - Easy
  - Medium
  - Difficult
- The test is adaptive and sets difficulty of succeeding section based on the performance in current.
- If you perform well in first section, the next section will be harder, and vice versa.
- Everyone starts with medium difficulty questions.
- Remember: Test is not question adaptive, it is section adaptive. That means the difficulty of questions in a section is not dependent on the performance in that section, but on the performance in the previous section.
- `However:` Questions in Quantitative Comparison tend to become difficult as you go on in single section.
- `PS:` Old GRE was question adaptive, but new GRE is not.


### 1.7: Time Saving Techniques
- `Verbal:` Read the question first, then read the passage.
- `Verbal:` Text completions are difficult, try not to spend more time on each.
- `Quant:` Quantitative Comparison questions get harder eventually, feel free to skip last few questions and get back to them afterwards.
